## Introduction

React hooks, introduced in React 16.8, allow developers to use state and lifecycle features in functional components. This repository provides a comprehensive set of examples for each hook, ensuring you understand both their basic and advanced use cases.

## Features

- Covers all React hooks, including basic, additional, and custom hooks.
- Real-world scenarios showcasing practical use cases.
- Easy-to-follow examples with clear explanations.
- Lightweight and modular for quick reference.

## Available Hooks

The repository includes examples for the following hooks:

### Basic Hooks
- **useState**: Manage state in functional components.
- **useEffect**: Handle side effects like data fetching or DOM manipulation.
- **useContext**: Access the React Context API without prop drilling.

### Additional Hooks
- **useReducer**: Manage more complex state logic.
- **useCallback**: Optimize callback functions for performance.
- **useMemo**: Memoize expensive computations.
- **useRef**: Access and persist values across renders.
- **useLayoutEffect**: Trigger effects synchronously after DOM mutations.
- **useImperativeHandle**: Customize refs forwarded to child components.

### Custom Hooks
- **useFetch**: Simplify data fetching logic.
- **useToggle**: Manage boolean state toggling.
- **useDebounce**: Handle debounced values efficiently.
- More custom hooks showcasing reusable patterns.
